# 2014 Exploratory Data Analysis exdata-002 Project 1

This is a submission by @simkimsia at GitHub for the Coursera course
Exploratory Data Analysis course code: exdata-002 Project 1 in May 2014.

Below are the instructions of the problem and copied directly from the coursera

The project README is divided into 2 separate files:
 1. My own notes (here in READMEFIRST.md)
 2. Problem statement (read <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>)

# Assumptions

 1. Evaluator has placed the text file `household_power_consumption.txt` into the root folder of this project.
 2. Evaluator is using either Windows or Mac
 3. Evaluator has installed the package `sqldf`
 
# How to begin

 1. Go <a href="https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1"> Roger Peng's repo</a> and fork the project
 2. Read the README and download the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">zip file</a>.
 3. Realize that:
   - the text file is semi colon delimited
   - you are supposed to load the data from the text file unzipped from the zip file
   - you need only a subset of the data in the text file
   - the subset needed falls into 2 dates 1/2/2007 and 2/2/2007
 4. Get the data subset correctly and you should see 2880 obs. of 9 variables. This is largely taken care of by my `load_data.R` <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/load_data.R">script</a>
 5. Create a plot script for each scenario. In my case they are :
   - <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot1.R">plot1.R</a>
   - <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot2.R">plot2.R</a>
   - <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot3.R">plot3.R</a>
   - <a href="https://github.com/simkimsia/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot4.R">plot4.R</a>
   
Imaginative naming, I know. :)
